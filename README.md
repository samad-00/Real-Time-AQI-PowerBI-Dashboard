🌍 Real-Time Air Quality Index (AQI) Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard built using a LIVE Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset from the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform, Government of India.
The project focuses on real-time air quality monitoring, pollutant analysis, and root-cause exploration across Indian cities and states.

📌 Project Overview

Air pollution is a critical environmental and public health concern in India. This project leverages live government data to analyze and visualize real-time AQI levels, helping identify pollution hotspots, dominant pollutants, and severely affected locations.

The dashboard is designed to support data-driven insights through advanced Power BI visuals and AI-assisted analysis.

⚠️ Data is fetched using a live API and refreshes periodically.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze real-time AQI levels across Indian cities and states

Identify best and worst cities based on AQI values

Study pollutant-wise contributions to air quality deterioration

Categorize air quality into standard AQI categories (Good to Severe)

Perform root-cause analysis using AI-based visuals

📊 Dashboard Features

Best & Worst City Analysis based on AQI values

State-wise AQI comparison using bar and line charts

Geographical AQI visualization using map visuals

Pollutant analysis for PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃

AQI Category distribution (Good, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe)

Decomposition Tree (AI Visual) to break AQI by:

State

City

Monitoring Station

Dynamic slicers for State, AQI Category, and Pollutant selection

Automated AQI alerts highlighting severe pollution conditions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
